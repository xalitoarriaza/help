## Usage

We currently have a BYOL integration with New Relic. That basically means: You need an account over at New Relic. Then you only need to paste the license key in our dashboard.

### Over at New Relic

1. Sign up or log in to [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/). 
1. Add a new application
1. Copy the license key

### At fortrabbit

1. Log in to the Dashboard
1. Navigate to your App > Settings > PHP > Debugging
1. Paste the New Relic license key
1. Save the PHP Settings

## Future changes

The current implementation is just the first revision. In the future you will be able to book New Relic as an Add-On from the dashboard directly.
