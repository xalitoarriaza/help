## Free trial

There is no [free web hosting](http://blog.fortrabbit.com/free-web-hosting) and that's ok. But you can test fortrabbit before you pay a dime. All you need to do is: sign up to fortrabbit and try it for free.  Of course: You don't need to opt-out, but you can, of course, opt-in.

## Pay after usage

No upfront costs nor payment! **First you book a component, then you'll use it, then we'll invoice you** for what you have actually used.

## Cancel anything at any time

You can always quit. Scale down or kill certain Apps or even cancel your Account completely.

## Monthly invoices

Within the first days of every new month you will get the invoice for your last month's consumption. You can also download all your previous invoices in the Dashboard.

## Daily billing cycle

When you book a Component on the 16th day of a month and the month has 30 days you only pay for the 15 days you're using the product. The minimum billing period is one day. For paid support this rule does not apply! Support plans are billed in full calendar month increments.

## Plans & prices

The service structure is modular. Most Components come in different size and flavors, you can combine anything as needed. Please see our **[pricing page](http://www.fortrabbit.com/pricing)** for an up-to-date pricing & product table.

## Storage & traffic limits

Each App includes a fair amount of web storage and traffic. These are soft limits, small exceeding and peaks will be tolerated. See our [specs page](http://www.fortrabbit.com/specs) for over-traffic costs.

## Costs monitoring

Log in to the Dashboard > Billing Contact. There you'll find a cost preview for the ongoing month, covering all of your Apps.

## Payment methods

You can pay by **credit card** (Visa & Master, no debit cards) or **SEPA direct debit** (EU clients only). For "enterprise clients" we also offer to pay by **bill** (on account).


## Billing mail address

You can setup a different e-mail address for each Billing Contact.

## Taxes

fortrabbit is a B2B hosting solution, it's for entrepreneurs only, we expect you to use it professionally. While that can mean anything and nothing it has some fiscal implications:

* Our prices are shown as net prices without Value Added Tax (VAT).
* If you are a non-VAT registered company in a EU country, we add VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in a EU country and add your valid VAT IN, we don't charge you VAT.
* If you are a VAT-registered company in Germany, we add VAT, but you will get it back from your tax-office.
* If you are a company from a NON-EU country, we don't charge you VAT.

### VAT-IN from clients in EU countries

We recommend to enter your VAT-IN with your Billing Contact. This way you save upfront costs for VAT â€” reverse charge makes this possible.

## Why am I charged?

We get a few e-mails each month after invoicing. People are used to pay upfront for stuff they book online. Due to the above described fair pricing, upfront payments are not possible with fortrabbit. A fortrabbit invoice is like your old-school telephone bill, you'll get it at the start of each month, the performance period is the last month.
