On fortrabbit you won't find any old-school server admin control panel like CPanel. The fortrabbit dashboard is designed to give you fine-grained control over all of your Apps, manage collaboration and associated billing. It's pretty self-explaining. It's supposed to work in modern desktop browsers, including IE11.


## Access the Dashboard

When you first sign up to fortrabbit you will be guided in boarding the Dashboard. Later you can always access it under: [https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com](https://dashboard.fortrabbit.com) in your browser.

## Dashboard scope

* **Apps**: create, manage, scale and delete all of your Apps, get access credentials, set all kind of App-specific configurations, see metrics
* **Collaboration**: Manage your own teams and join other teams.
* **Account**: Manage your SSH access keys, password, e-mail preferences and everything else associated.
* **Billing**: Manage your different Companies and Billing Contacts, see invoices.
