We have two generations of Apps here on fortrabbit: Old Apps (2013 - mid 2016) and [New Apps](new-apps) (from 2015 on). The Old Apps are a bit different to the New Apps. This article lists resources to work with the Old Apps.


## Deprecation warning

Please be warned that the Old Apps are currently phasing out. We recommend not create any new Old App any more. Support is only granted until mid 2016. 


## Persistent storage and runtime data

While New Apps have ephemeral storage, Old Apps have a **persistent storage** with access via [SSH](ssh-sftp-old-app) and permanent write access on the file system.
