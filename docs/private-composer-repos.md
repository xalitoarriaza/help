Modern PHP App development utilizes [Composer](composer) as a dependency manager. There are many great open source packages [out there](http://packagist.org). But your company code is probably not intended to be released to public. That's when you use private Composer repositories â€” protected by SSH public key authentication.

To use your private Composer repo you need to set up authentication so your fortrabbit App can access your external repo (probably hosted on Bitbucket, GitHub etc). For this you need a public and private SSH key-pair. Here is how you generate it for your App:

```bash
ssh git@deploy.eu2.frbit.com keygen my-app
# Generating new SSH key pair
#   Done 447ms
# 
# Your SSH public key:
# ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAA...ixx47pDIa1xtMV4odTimp
```

The private key will not be displayed (you don't need it either). The public key in the example is starting at `ssh-rsa AAA...` and ending at `..odTimp`.

You can now install the key in your private Composer repository - something like BitBucket, GitHub or the one from your company. You can re-run this command at any time to view or change the current key of your App.

### Link your private repo

Now you can add your private repositories into your `composer.json` file like usual:

```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url":  "git@github.com:my-company/my-package.git"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "my-company/my-package": "1.2.*"
    }
}
```
